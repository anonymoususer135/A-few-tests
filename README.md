## Concept Summary

The purpose of this project is to create an app that will help keep track of items being stored in warehouses. As we all know businesses often order their items in bulk ensuring that they have enough supply to meet the demand of customers. Most of the supply is held in warehouses, and there are instances where supply could get miscounted or “lost” when shipping items in and out of a warehouse. With this app, businesses will be able to keep a detailed log of the inventory moving in and out of a warehouse to ensure fewer mistakes are being made. If a mistake is made then the app has an accountability feature that requires an employee to make an account. This will lower the number of mistakes being made saving businesses the money they would have otherwise probably lost due to negligent workers.


## Audience/Customer

The intended audience for this app would mainly be businesses that need to store items and keep detailed tracking of those items. This could range from small businesses to large business chains. An example of a business that would be interested in an app like this would be retail businesses as they tend to store a lot of their products in warehouses to then ship out to their various locations to sell.
Additionally, small businesses that just need a simple way of managing their products would find this app beneficial.


## Background

The background information necessary to understand the project includes the appropriate price and quantity of the item the user chooses to add to or remove from the database according to the brand. It would also include definitions and current events for updates of the app’s features.
Some information that could be useful for understanding this project could be the terms shrinkage, and warehouse optimization. The term shrinkage is used in business when there is a loss of inventory. It is usually associated with employee theft, shoplifting, damaged items, and miscounts. We’ll focus on miscounts for the purpose of this project. With the accountability feature on the app, it will apply extra pressure to employees to not miscount items being checked in or out so as to not receive punishment. The other term "warehouse optimization" refers to making a warehouse as efficient as possible. With the practical design of the app’s interface, checking items in and out will be done in no time ensuring more time is put into optimizing other areas of a warehouse.



## Application Cost and Projected success

For application cost, we would start with our app being a free app. The idea is to obtain a good start with some people, to later more people purchasing our app while we fix bugs or add more features suggested by customers or self-decided. Then we would start to increase the price as our projected success starts to increase, starting with $0.99. 
Another route can also include a month free a company has to pay for using our application. (After further updates)

## Design - Detailed Design

The design will first have the log in page containing the username and password, as well as a sign up button if the user does not have an account for the app. The sign up button will lead to a page which contains the first name, last name, email, and password, and a checkbox for the user to check to agree to the terms of service and privacy policy. It will have a continue button and below that, a link to the sign in page if the user already has an account. Both the continue button in the sign up page and the sign in button in the start page will lead to the user’s profile, containing the options to add a new item, scan in, scan out, and price and quantity, and under the four options, a log out link to bring the user to the start page. The add new item button first leads to eight inputs; the item’s name, type, brand, condition, quantity, price, color, and comments. The type input has the user tap on the Android or iPhone brand, and condition has the user tap on either the new condition or used condition. Under the inputs, there is an Enter button which leads the user to a barcode with an export button under it, and under the barcode and export button is a main menu button leading the user to their profile. The export button under the barcode exports the item the user has described, and the barcode is scanned in to add the item to the inventory. The scan in button leads to a camera, then a scanned in page and a scanned in log screen once the user has scanned an item. The scanned out button shows a scanned out page and the scanned out log page, and the quote/price search scans an item and shows the description of the item scanned.


## Related Work

Related products would be Warehouse management from the Play Store to hold items in users’ inventories.


## Frameworks/Services/Cloud/Backends

We will be using Android as a framework, and google for searching for item qualities to display to the user after scanning an item with the app.



## Testing

-A first account, normally a test account would be created by a volunteer from the industry. The volunteer would then try adding a new item and accessing the barcode and the quality of the item which they inserted into the app. They would then try scanning in an item with the camera to check the inventory, as well as scanning out an item from the inventory. The volunteer will finally scan an item to read its quality and price. They will then fill out a survey on their experience with our app and include on how it can be improved.

## Schedule


## Dependencies

The dependencies of this work to be completed would be an understanding of the brands and qualities of items the user would be to scan with the app.
